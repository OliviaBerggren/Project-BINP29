Aim:
The aim is to create a script that can calculate the overall GC-content, the GC-content for all three positions in the codon
and codon usage. Codon bias!!!!!!!?????????????

>>>>>>> Python script
The script calculate the overall GC-content, the GC-content in 1:st, 2:nd and 3:rd position in codon.
It calculates the codon usage, CODON BIAS?!?!?!?!?!?!? the length of the sequence.

The script needs to be run with a fasta file. There should be two arguments (name of the scrips + fasta file).
