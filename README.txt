Aim:
The aim is to create a script that can calculate the GC-content for all three positions in the codon,

>>>>>>> Python script
The script calculate the overall GC-content, the GC-content for 1:st, 2:nd and 3:rd position in codon.
It calculate the number of each codon, the longest-, shortest- and the average length of the sequences.

The script needs to be run with a fasta file. There should be two arguments (name of the scrips + fasta file).






>>>>>>> Git
git init (create a new repository)
git add (prepare a commit)
git commit -m "write a message"

>>>>>>> GitHub:
Create a new respository called Project-BINP29.
